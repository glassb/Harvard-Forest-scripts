# HF21-Scripts
A backup for my scripts for the [Harvard Forest] (https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/) REU program, in collaboration
with the [Wofsy-Munger Group] (http://atmos.seas.harvard.edu/lab/) on Biosphere-Atmosphere Exchange (Harvard University).

Google Earth Engine Scripts that wrangle input data can be found here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/bglass/HF21

To clone the GEE git repository, type the following in terminal:

```
git clone https://earthengine.googlesource.com/users/bglass/HF21
```

Thanks for stopping by!
